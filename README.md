# Enhanced_Input_Setup
A Sample Repo of the enhanced inputs setup within the unreal engine

has a very bare bones setup for how to go about using the enhanced inputs along with the input actions setup for these 2 movements

The project was made using UE5.2 but this should be fine to use in any version of 5.0 as it's mainly boiler plate stuff to setup the project
