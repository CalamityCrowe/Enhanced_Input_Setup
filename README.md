# Enhanced_Input_Setup
A Sample Repo of the enhanced inputs setup within the unreal engine

has a very bare bones setup for how to go about using the enhanced inputs along with the input actions setup for these 2 movements

The project was made using UE5.2 but this should be fine to use in any version of 5.0 as it's mainly boiler plate stuff to setup the project

if you are adding this to another project, make sure to go into the project settings and change the default player input and default input component classes to use the enhanced versions instead
